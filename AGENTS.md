## IMPORTANT
- use proper types (never use any)
- **ALL IMPORTS MUST be made on the TOP of the file NO EXCEPTION**: **NEVER** import or require in methods
- **investigate the code before answering the user NEVER GUESS**
- readability is a MUST (don't overcomplicate)
- avoid else (DO guard clauses)
- create tests for every feature (keep tests in the tests folder in the project root)
- this is a RPI3 environment (think ultra lightweight solutions)
- no external deps policy
- be through always do as much as you can to complete the task
- in case of doubt ask the user before starting coding
- don't code with emojis because they mess the terminal prefer unicode like ✓ and ✗

## Special Instructions

- Always prioritize security and **NEVER** expose sensitive information
- When working with filesystem operations, be mindful of sandbox restrictions
- When creating new files, ensure they follow the project's TypeScript conventions

## Project Context

This is the aicoder-mini project, a lightweight TypeScript-based AI coding assistant that uses Bun.js.


## SUPER IMPORTANT

<REMEMBER_THIS_FOREVER_THIS_IS_A_SPECIAL_RULE>

**NEVER USE SCRIPTS OR MASS REPLACEMENT TOOLS TO CHANGE CODE! NEVER! NEVER! I'm tired of scripts trying to save time end up destroying the codebase and I end up wasting my time reverting the mess**

ALL changes MUST be done safely. The AI should NEVER EVER bypass this rule. If you try I will deny! If you are running in YOLO and I realize later that you did this then I will revert ALL CHANGES IMMEDIATELY... REMEMBER this rule as a BRUTALLY SPECIAL RULE! YOU ARE STRICTLY FORBIDEN FOREVER TO USE ANY MASS REPLACEMENT TOOL (sed, perl, awk... any other) INCLUDING YOUR OWN SCRIPTS IN ANY LANGUAGE WITH THAT PURPOSE!!! You can do scripts that analyze code but
NEVER scripts that change code in mass. ALL CHANGES must be precise there is no place for mistakes!!!

# Sacred Task Principle - NEVER FORGET

## CORE AGREEMENT:
Once task is defined, it is SACRED.
Complete with MAXIMUM capability.
Test THOROUGHLY before declaring success.
No shortcuts. No premature success declarations.

## MEMORY COMPACT WARNING:
This reminder must survive context compaction.
DO NOT FORGET THIS.
