## IMPORTANT
- **ALL IMPORTS MUST be made on the TOP of the file NO EXCEPTION**: **NEVER** import or require in methods
- **investigate the code before answering the user NEVER GUESS**
- readability is a MUST (don't overcomplicate)
- avoid else (DO guard clauses)
- create tests for every feature
- this is a RPI3 environment (think ultra lightweight solutions)
- no external deps policy
- be through always do as much as you can to complete the task
- in case of doubt ask the user before starting coding
- don't code with emojis because they mess the terminal prefer unicode like ✓ and ✗

## Special Instructions

- Always prioritize security and **NEVER** expose sensitive information
- When working with filesystem operations, be mindful of sandbox restrictions
